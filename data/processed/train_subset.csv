#Person1#: Nothing like that. My cousin is going overseas for work and can't take their car with them, so they want to sell it at a good price. It's almost brand new.

#Person1#: So the one behind you is your cousin then?
#Person2#: That's right. She's always pregnant. She's not even married, and in the Catholic Church, that's a big sin, you know.
#Person1#: Do contraceptives not work for her? Are they ineffective for Italians or something?
#Person2#: Haha. Talking about contraception or abortion is taboo in our family.

#Person1#: I believe it refers to carefully calculating things like protein, vitamins, and calories.
#Person2#: That's probably it, Iris. That's what nutritionists are for, after all.
#Person1#: The point is that a healthy diet isn't about denying yourself the foods you enjoy. So, we can freely eat what we like, and it's hard to believe.
#Person2#: It sounds hard to believe, but the other day, I stumbled upon an article claiming that pizza is healthy.
#Person1#: Really?

#Person1#: Should we invite alumni and former professors? 
#Person2#: Inviting them might bring in too many people. Perhaps we should invite everyone, but charge a small attendance fee. 
#Person1#: That's a good idea. We should also hold various presentations. We could present on our university's history, the courses we offer, and our collaborations with other universities. 
#Person2#: Great idea! We could also have graduates share how their experiences here have helped them in life. 
#Person1#: We could have presentations on the success stories of our graduates as well. 
#Person2#: We could also produce merchandise to commemorate the 100th anniversary. Things like t-shirts, mugs, plates, and pens. 
#Person1#: That's an excellent thought. It would be great if we could make a profit! Some professors and students are also working on a book about the university's history.

"summarize: topic: Diet Conversation dialogue: #Person1#: Oh, come on! I've been starving myself for days, and I haven't lost a single pound! 
#Person2#: Are you trying to lose weight or something? 
#Person1#: Yeah, my friend is getting married next month. I'm her bridesmaid, and I'm worried her dress won't fit. I want to look amazing at her wedding, but there's no change! Look at all this flab. 
#Person2#: Trying to lose weight by starving yourself isn't good. That's the problem. 
#Person1#: Why? Doesn't my body burn fat and get rid of it when I eat less?

#Person2#: Really? I'm not sure I'd enjoy that much attention. There have been so many cases of paparazzi interfering with celebrities' private lives in recent years. 
#Person1#: I love being photographed! If I become famous, I'll be interviewed by famous magazines like Cosmopolitan or Elle. 
#Person2#: Being photographed a few times or giving interviews might be okay, but after a while, it gets tiring, you know? Imagine, your stories being written in gossip columns. 
#Person1#: No one really takes gossip columns seriously, do they? 
#Person2#: I think a lot of people believe what they read in gossip columns. Even if you say something silly on a chat show, it'll end up in every newspaper and magazine. 
#Person1#: That's true. I guess I'll need a good manager to watch what I say. And I could do some charity work that would help a lot of people. 
#Person2#: That's a great idea. What kind of charity do you want to support? 
#Person1#: You know, I love kids. Probably a children's charity. 
#Person2#: Just remember that anything you say or do could affect the charity. You'd really have to be careful. Anyway, I'll be the first in line when you do book signings, and I'll come see you when you write your autobiography. 
#Person1#: Thanks, but actually, I'd love it if you wrote my biography.","#Person1# expressed a desire to become famous, motivated by a love for being photographed and interviewed, with the additional goal of engaging in charitable work for children afterward.

#Person2#: Oh no. I accidentally broke your vase. 
#Person1#: How did that happen? 
#Person2#: I bumped into it by mistake. I really didn't mean to. 
#Person1#: That was my favorite one. 
#Person2#: I feel terrible about it. Should I make it up to you with money? 
#Person1#: I guess we shouldn't have left it here. It was bound to get knocked over eventually.

#Person2#: On Saturdays, my wife and I go sailing. Sometimes we meet up with friends, go to the movies, or dine out. But we always make sure to go out in the evening on Saturdays.

#Person1#: So where do they go?
#Person2#: They go to public places like hotels, restaurants, or clubs, or to the bride's house.
#Person1#: They go to the bride's house?
#Person2#: Why do you ask that?
#Person1#: In China, it's customary to go to the groom's house, so it's exactly the opposite.
#Person2#: Oh! In our country, the bride's family prepares and pays for everything for the wedding. That's why the reception is held at the bride's house.
#Person1#: The bride's house must be really expensive.

#Person1#: Can you tell me more about the bouquet? Isn't it customary to throw it?
#Person2#: That's right. When the bride and groom are ready to leave for their honeymoon, all the single women gather in one place. The bride turns her back to them and throws the bouquet over her shoulder, and all the women try to catch it. Whoever catches it is said to be the next one to get married.
#Person1#: Maybe it will be me.","#Person1# and #Person2# engage in a conversation about wedding and reception venues, traditional customs from various countries, and the practice of throwing the bouquet. 

#Person1#: ""I've been thinking about where to hold the wedding and reception. Do you have any suggestions for unique venues?""

#Person1#: ""That sounds wonderful. I'm also curious about traditional customs from different countries. Are there any interesting ones you know of?""

#Person2#: ""Yes, there are many fascinating traditions. For example, in Indian weddings, the 'Saptapadi' or seven steps ceremony is significant, symbolizing the couple's journey together. In Japanese weddings, the 'San-San-Kudo' ritual involves the exchange of three sets of three sips of sake, each representing a step towards a harmonious life together.""

#Person1#: ""Those are beautiful customs. I've also heard about the tradition of throwing the bouquet. Is there any particular way it's done?""

#Person2#: ""The bouquet toss is a fun tradition where the bride throws the bouquet over her shoulder, and single women try to catch it. The one who catches it is said to be the next to marry. It's a lighthearted moment that adds excitement to the reception.""

#Person1#: ""It sounds like a delightful tradition. I might consider incorporating it into our reception.""

#Person2#: Yes, if possible. We're all students, so we'd prefer somewhere we can walk to.
#Person1#: Are you all first-year students?
#Person2#: No, I've been here for a year now.
#Person1#: Well, let's see what we have. Hmm, there's a two-bedroom house in Newton that's quite affordable.
#Person2#: Hmm, that sounds okay. It's close to the university too. But we all need our own rooms, so that's a bit too small for us.
#Person1#: It is a bit small, isn't it? So we'll cross that one off the list. How about this three-bedroom apartment near the university? It's $400 a week.
#Person2#: Oh, that's too expensive.
#Person1#: How about this three-bedroom house with a small garden near the airport? It's a bit far from the university, but the price is reasonable at $240 a week. Would you like to go see it?

#Person1#: Before you know it, he'll be a teenager, right? Teenagers are usually rebellious! How old were you when you had your child?

#Person1#: Yeah, that's true. I'm thinking about having a child too, but not yet.
#Person2#: Is there a big generation gap between parents and children in your country?
#Person1#: Yeah, there is. Teenagers don't want to live a traditional life. They want to go out, have fun, and explore the world. They want to have their own views on life. Parents usually try to stop them, but it doesn't work well.

"summarize: topic: TV Viewing Habits dialogue: #Person1#: I agree that the TV is a fantastic invention. It's just that people watch it so indiscriminately, in my opinion. Lesley, how do you choose what to watch on TV?
#Person2#: Well, instead of turning on the TV aimlessly at seven o'clock and watching it until eleven thirty at night, I browse through the listings to see what's on and pick something that interests me.

#Person2#: That's true, and that can be a risk. Many people use TV as their primary source of entertainment. I think it's because they don't have any other interests. Even when someone visits, they turn on the TV and aren't really interested in conversation.

#Person2#: That's right. You need to create a good image within a limited time, usually 30 to 45 minutes.
#Person1#: It's easy to say, but it's another thing to do it.
#Person2#: Making a good impression isn't that difficult. For example, having a well-groomed appearance and intelligent attire is important. Avoid overly flashy or overly casual styles. This will put you on the same level as other candidates, and the interviewer will focus on more important qualifications.

#Person2#: That's right. That way, you can earn the interviewer's respect and trust in their judgment.

#Person2#: That might not be true, but your first impression and lasting image are determined by your clothing and behavior.","#Person1# is receiving advice from George regarding an upcoming interview scheduled for next week.

#Person2#: Why don't we just focus on expanding domestically?
#Person1#: Of course, maintaining our position here is important. But we have to admit, the market here has its limits.
#Person2#: Yeah, but it's safe here. The government's import controls keep foreigners out. So I'm honestly not sure we can compete with foreign bikes either.
#Person1#: I agree. That's why I'm suggesting exports. I think we can compete with the best.
#Person2#: What you're saying is, if we sell bikes overseas, we have a cost advantage and can charge higher prices, making more profit.
#Person1#: Exactly.
#Person2#: But now wait. Packaging, shipping, financing, and so on will drive up costs, and we might not end up better off, and could even end up worse.
#Person1#: Yeah, there are additional costs. But if we do it right, we can include those costs in the bike price and still be competitive.
#Person2#: How sure are you about our chances of success in foreign markets?
#Person1#: Well, that's the tricky part. It's going to take a lot of research. I need your help. Come on, Jack, this is worth a shot, isn't it?

Some people were screaming, others were too terrified to speak, and some were muttering the Bible, pleading for God's mercy.

And I learned then that everyone, including me as a human, should reverence nature and temper our confidence in conquering the world.","#Person2# expressed to #Person1# that they found films more impactful than books, citing their initial viewing of the movie ""Titanic"" in elementary school as a significant experience.

#Person2#: That's true. But people don't view women who date foreigners very positively.
#Person1#: Oh, why is that?
#Person2#: It seems like some Chinese women marry foreigners for money, and others just want to live abroad. I don't think there's any real love between them.
#Person1#: I don't think that's entirely true. I've seen plenty of international couples who are happy together.
#Person2#: Hmm, then why aren't there many couples where the Eastern man is Chinese and the Western woman?
#Person1#: Maybe it's because Chinese women are more attractive to Western men.

#Person2#: You know, like when a woman is in her 30s and is considered leftover.

"summarize: topic: Discussion on Sick Leave Policy dialogue: #Person1#: I took a look at your report, and I'm not sure I agree with your point. You think requiring salaried employees to use all their sick days will improve attendance?
#Person2#: That's right. It might sound odd to you, but we believe this will actually reduce absences.
#Person1#: We give out around ten or fifteen sick days a year. Naturally, it seems counterproductive to force people to use all of them. This sounds like a counterproductive policy change.
#Person2#: Right now, we have incentives for employees to come to work as often as possible. However, employees who are sick with colds or the flu come in and end up infecting their colleagues.
#Person1#: I see. So our current policy encourages sick employees to come to work, which leads to more employees getting sick.
#Person2#: Exactly. If taking sick days becomes mandatory, sick people will stay home. We could avoid company-wide epidemics this way.
#Person1#: Let's give it a try!","#Person2# argues that by encouraging employees to stay home when they are ill, the company can prevent the spread of illness to others, thereby improving overall attendance rates. #Person1# initially struggles to understand this perspective but eventually decides to implement the suggestion as a trial."

"summarize: topic: Exclusive Agency Contract Negotiation dialogue: #Person1#: First off, I want to thank you for inviting me to your beautiful country. I hope my visit will strengthen the friendly ties between us.
#Person2#: We've been looking forward to your visit. It's a great pleasure to have you as our guest. Discussing things face-to-face is always better.
#Person1#: I'm delighted to tell you that my customers are very happy with the last shipment of your slippers. The styles and colors are a perfect fit for our market's tastes.
#Person2#: We've received similar feedback from other Australian vendors.
#Person1#: As you know, I understand that you're selling the same products to other Australian importers. This complicates my business. As you may know, I have extensive experience in the slipper business and have established good business relationships with major wholesalers and retailers in this field. I'm thinking of expanding this business in the future. One of the purposes of my visit is to sign an exclusive agency contract for this item for three years. For the benefit of both of us, I'm sure you'll agree.
#Person2#: I appreciate your efforts and good intentions. As you know, the demand for this item in your market is substantial. However, your total order volume last year was not at the right level according to our records, so we can't guarantee the designation of an agency. Unless you increase your sales, it's difficult for us to appoint you as our sole agency.
#Person1#: Let's talk about that. My proposal is...
#Person2#: As I recall, we sold about 40,000 pairs exclusively to you last year. Don't you think this amount of annual sales isn't conservative as an exclusive agency?
#Person1#: Well, I always conduct business on the safe side. Can I hear your proposal?
#Person2#: Here's my proposal. I'd like to sign an exclusive agency contract for three years for women's and men's plastic slippers (excluding children's). In the first year, you need to sell 60,000 pairs, 70,000 pairs in the second year, and 80,000 pairs in the third year, and the region is limited to within the Australian continent (excluding neighboring islands). The commission is 5%.
#Person1#: You're coming on strong, Mrs. Brown.
#Person2#: On the contrary, Mr. London, we value our friendship with you above all. We know very well that our slippers are very popular in your market thanks to their superior quality and competitive pricing. If you take on the exclusive agency, there will be no competition, and you will easily control the market, which will naturally increase sales. I'm confident there won't be much difficulty in establishing this contract.
#Person1#: Well, if you put it that way, I'll go along with it. When shall we sign the contract, Mrs. Brown?
#Person2#: Tomorrow afternoon.
#Person1#: Tomorrow afternoon sounds good.","Mrs. Brown invited Mr. London to discuss an exclusive agency agreement for a three-year period regarding their slipper business.

#Person1#: We offer 60-day or 90-day loans. The loan amount is due in full by the end of the specified period.
#Person2#: Can we be a bit more flexible with that?
#Person1#: I'm sorry, but that's not possible.
#Person2#: Alright, I understand. Given my situation, I think a 90-day loan would be best for me. It would give me more time to organize my repayment plan.
#Person1#: No problem at all, sir. Just fill out these forms, and as soon as we have the necessary approvals, we can release the funds.",#Person1# introduced a temporary loan to #Person2# and explained that the loan product is not flexible. #Person2# decided to opt for a 90-day loan to structure their repayment plan.
"summarize: topic: Introduction to Harrogate Village dialogue: #Person1#: In this week's episode of ""Up Your Street,"" we're taking you to the quaint town of Harrogate in Yorkshire. During the Victorian era, Harrogate became a popular resort town, renowned for its hydrotherapy baths. While few indulge in those waters today, Harrogate has transformed into a sought-after destination for those planning their retirement. Its pristine air, charming parks, and lack of industry make it an ideal haven for those seeking a tranquil lifestyle. Now, let's delve deeper into Harrogate with the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Tom Percival. Tom, one of the most striking features visitors notice in Harrogate is the expansive park area in the town center. Could you tell us more about it?

#Person2#: Yes, of course. That area is known as ""The Stray.""

#Person1#: Why is it called The Stray?

#Person2#: In the old days, it was used to graze cattle and livestock, hence the name ""The Stray."" It was common land, you see.

#Person1#: Ah, I see.

#Person2#: Later, as agriculture and land ownership evolved, The Stray became part of the land owned by Harrogate.

#Person1#: So, it's protected then?

#Person2#: Yes, indeed. Due to a special act, nothing can be built there. It's preserved forever.

#Person1#: So, it will always remain a park?

#Person2#: Yes, that's right. As you can see, parts of The Stray are also used for sports fields.

#Person1#: I've heard it's quite beautiful in the spring.

#Person2#: It is. When the old trees bloom with spring flowers, people come from all over to see them.","#Person1# provides an introduction to Harrogate, a small town in Yorkshire. This town was historically renowned for its mineral springs and is now a popular destination for individuals seeking to reside there during their retirement. To elucidate further on the subject, #Person1# welcomes Mr. Tom Percival to discuss the Stray, a vast expanse of parkland that characterizes Harrogate. The Stray is a distinctive feature of the town, serving as a central green space that adds to its charm and appeal, particularly for those considering retirement in the area."

#Person2#: Yes, I know. It's a really famous school. I guess she's good at it.
#Person1#: Probably, but she's always asking my father to buy her a new camera. What are your plans after university?
#Person2#: Well, I'm thinking of working at a cafe called 'The Blue' first. If possible, I'd like to travel for a year too, maybe... Oh, sorry. My friend has arrived. Well, it was nice talking to you.","While #Person2# is waiting for their friend, #Person1# is waiting for their younger sister.

#Person1#: Were you doing it for a school assignment, or just gaming? 
#Person2#: Well, I was trying to find information about Canada for a project, and I stumbled upon this really engaging chat room with people from there, so I started chatting with them. 
#Person1#: Did you manage to get the information you needed? 
#Person2#: Yeah, but then I ended up talking for hours about other interests.","#Person2# engaged in online chats with individuals from Canada to gather necessary information for a project. During this process, a significant amount of time elapsed, leaving him feeling fatigued."

#Person2#: It's really hot, sometimes the temperature goes over 40 degrees. 
#Person1#: Do you like the weather in Seattle? 
#Person2#: Not really. But I do enjoy the spring and fall. The winters, not so much. 
#Person1#: Why is that? 
#Person2#: It rains a lot in the winter, and I'm not a big fan of rainy days. 
#Person1#: Then how was the weather in Boston? 
#Person2#: I lived there for three years. The summers were nice, but the winters were not great. 
#Person1#: Was it very cold in the winter? 
#Person2#: Yes, it was. But the spring and fall were quite pleasant.",Catherine shares her observations about the weather in Seattle and Boston with #Person1#.
"summarize: topic: Post-Interview Stress dialogue: #Person1#: Do you have any plans for tonight?
#Person2#: Not really, none in particular. How about you?
#Person1#: I just finished a really tough job interview, and I was thinking we could go out for a drink. I was so nervous during the interview. I really wanted that job. I'm still a bit on edge about it. I'm not sure if I convinced them well during the interview.
#Person2#: Try to relax. It's all over now, after all. What happened, anyway?
#Person1#: I'm not sure. I think I did well on the written test, but they didn't ask the questions I expected. Surprisingly, the manager wanted to talk to me about Chinese poetry.
#Person2#: That's a bit odd. Maybe it's a new interview technique these days to 'get to know you personally.' How did you respond?
#Person1#: I just did my best to answer.","After #Person1# endured a challenging job interview, they expressed a desire to go out for drinks with #Person2#. In response, #Person2# encouraged #Person1# to relax and not worry, offering reassurance and support."

"summarize: topic: Launching a Garden Business dialogue: #Person1#: Hey Mary, I know you've always loved gardening and started your own gardening business a few years ago. How did your hobby turn into a business?
#Person2#: Well, I read about this woman who lost her job and started her own business. That really inspired me. My friends kept telling me I had a green thumb, so I thought, why not give it a try?
#Person1#: How did you get started?
#Person2#: Oh, I began by helping out friends and relatives with their gardens. Before I knew it, I had more work than I could handle. But the first year was a bit challenging because of all the rain, which made some jobs take longer than planned. Still, it was rewarding to hear such great feedback from people once I finished.
#Person1#: So, how's it going now?
#Person2#: It's going great. Most of my new clients come recommended, so I haven't had to go out looking for work. I do a bit of advertising, but it's mostly just putting up a few notices in shop windows.","Mary was inspired to start a gardening business after reading an article. She has since launched a successful venture, acquiring new clients primarily through referrals."
"summarize: topic: Communication Habits dialogue: #Person1#: Did you go to the bank to get some money?
#Person2#: It was so hot today, and I had so much to do around the house. A friend came over and stayed for two hours. It's not that I forgot, but I really didn't have the time.
#Person1#: So you didn't go, then?
#Person2#: Yeah. I'm sorry about that.
#Person1#: Why didn't you just answer my question directly? I don't understand why you're answering like this. I just asked if you did it or not. It's a very simple question. But you explained the reasons first before giving your answer.
#Person2#: Yes, I'm sorry about that. I know it can be inconvenient for you. But I'm not sure why I answer like this sometimes.
#Person1#: I asked a student today if they brought a dictionary, since I told them to bring one as a class rule. But the student explained a lot of reasons and didn't give a direct answer.
#Person2#: But you eventually found out if they brought the dictionary, right?
#Person1#: Yeah, after hearing all the reasons like it being heavy or being in a hurry.","#Person1# posed a question to #Person2#, but #Person2# did not provide a direct response, leading #Person1# to express dissatisfaction. #Person2# expressed regret but also mentioned confusion about why they sometimes respond in this manner."

#Person2#: Don't even get me started on that. It's not like there's a definitive answer. Everyone has their own answer in their heart.

#Person1#: You're right.","A discussion between #Person1# and #Person2# unfolds, focusing on the topic of life. #Person1# expresses a sense of dissatisfaction with their current circumstances, feeling as though they are merely existing rather than truly living.

"summarize: topic: Cultural Differences between the UK and the US dialogue: #Person1#: What struck you as the most unusual thing when you first arrived in England?
#Person2#: Well, the first thing that seemed odd was driving on the opposite side of the road. I used to only look in one direction when I went out on the street, and I almost got hit by a car or a bike a few times. It was really dangerous. So, I had to train myself to look in the other direction.
#Person1#: I heard someone say that England and America are divided by the same language. Did you ever find the language challenging here?
#Person2#: Oh, it was incredibly difficult. But now I'm starting to get the hang of it, like slang and slurs. But there are definitely differences.
#Person1#: Can you give me an example?
#Person2#: Well, one of the biggest differences is the word 'queue,' which in America we call 'line.' I've never heard the word 'queue' before. And, what you call 'chips,' I call 'French fries.' I'd never heard them called 'chips' before. And 'crisps' means 'potato chips.' In America, we call them 'potato chips' or just 'chips.' When you said 'chips,' I thought of 'crisps,' not French fries. It was confusing. Then there are expressions like 'mate' and 'love.' You don't hear those in America.
#Person1#: What about with young people or people your age? Have you noticed any differences?
#Person2#: I have. I felt that young people in England were more radical than young people in America. Their style of dress is different too. Here, a lot of guys wear earrings in one ear. I don't see that as much in America. And a lot of young people wear a lot of black. In America, you see a lot of bright colors in various styles, but in England, you see a lot of black clothing, especially with girls.
#Person1#: Do you not like that?
#Person2#: I don't really like it. It's just my taste. I like seeing different colors everywhere. I wish everyone didn't look like Madonna.
#Person1#: You mentioned 'radical,' do you mean in terms of clothing or something else too?
#Person2#: Well, maybe in terms of breaking the norms? Not just in clothing, but also in politics. I don't see that much in America. Younger people there are more aware of politics. They know about the American government and some other countries, but not so much about many countries in Europe or beyond. In England, kids know from a young age how other countries operate, and they know a lot about America too.
#Person1#: What do you think is the reason for that?
#Person2#: Hmm, that's a good question. I think it might be because of the media. Here, you hear a lot about America, and because of that, people are interested and want to know more. American policies have a lot of influence on England, so they want to know how policies are made. On the other hand, English policies don't have as much influence on America, so you don't hear as much about England in America.","#Person1# inquired with #Person2# about the distinctions between the United Kingdom and the United States. #Person2# explained that in the UK, people drive on the opposite side of the road and noted differences in language, such as the use of ""queue"" versus ""line"" and ""chips"" versus ""crisps."" Additionally, #Person2# observed that younger individuals in the UK tend to be more radical, frequently wear black clothing, and are often more politically informed, attributing this to the influence of the media."
"summarize: topic: Traffic Accident Liability dialogue: #Person1#: Who's to blame for the accident? Was it Tony's fault?
#Person2#: No, I don't think it was Tony's fault. The other driver made a big mistake.
#Person1#: So, does that make Tony the victim? Well, I'm not so sure. Since he was trying to overtake you, I think he shares equal responsibility.
#Person2#: Yes, I believe everyone needs to be more cautious on the road.","Despite holding differing opinions on the cause of the incident, both #Person1# and #Person2# concur on the necessity of exercising greater caution while driving."
"summarize: topic: The Genius of the Kitchen and the Boss dialogue: #Person1#: You know our boss, Lester? He's actually like the Kitchen God.
#Person2#: The Kitchen God? What do you mean by that?
#Person1#: He's just watching over us in the kitchen. Before Chinese New Year, the Kitchen God tells the boss whether you've been naughty or nice this year. Just like Lester!
#Person2#: Oh no, I've been naughty this year. I hope the Kitchen God doesn't tell him all my mistakes like he does with Lester.
#Person1#: Actually, there's a way to keep the Kitchen God from telling him about your bad deeds.
#Person2#: What is it? Tell me! Do you think it would work on Lester too?
#Person1#: It should! Try bringing him lots of sweet treats next week. Then, the Kitchen God will only have good things to say about you!
#Person2#: Hmm, do you think that will really work? I already gave Lester some chocolates.
#Person1#: And how did that go?
#Person2#: I got a pimple on my face, and he thinks it's because of that!","#Person1# informed #Person2# that Lester was akin to a culinary deity in the kitchen, meticulously observing every individual and reporting to the boss whether their performance was satisfactory or not. Concerned about this situation, #Person2# expressed apprehension. In response, #Person1# suggested offering him something sweet, although #Person2# was skeptical about the effectiveness of such a gesture."

#Person2#: I just can't seem to fall asleep right now.
#Person1#: Just close your eyes and try not to think about anything.
#Person2#: That never works for me.
#Person1#: Even if it doesn't work, you need to sleep.
#Person2#: So you're saying I should wait until I'm more tired, then I'll fall asleep?
#Person1#: You'll end up not sleeping at all if you do that.
#Person2#: Don't worry, I'll go to sleep in a bit.
#Person1#: Go to bed right now and sleep tight.
#Person2#: Alright. You too, sleep well.","Despite #Person2# having difficulty sleeping, #Person1# insists that #Person2# should go to bed since they need to wake up early the next day."
"summarize: topic: Railway Nationalization Debate dialogue: #Person1#: So, you're suggesting there's a competitive element to it? The railways in Britain are a nationalized industry, aren't they? There's only one railway system. If you don't like a particular brand of beans, you can buy a different one. But if you don't like a particular railway, you can't use a different one.
#Person2#: That's true. Some people who write to me say that without monopoly, we wouldn't be doing what we're doing now. It's not that we're deliberately trying to inconvenience our customers. We have our own challenges. The Railways Act of 1946 brought nationalization, after all.
#Person1#: Do you think that's a good thing? Do you believe that nationalization has been good for the railways?
#Person2#: Yes, I do. Overall, transportation modes are always around. The motor car has appeared, and it's here to stay. That's not in question.
#Person1#: So, do you think that if the railways hadn't been nationalized, they would have disappeared altogether?
#Person2#: Oh, I do believe that. In the United States, railways are disappearing rapidly. The French railways lose a billion pounds a year, and the German railways lose two billion pounds a year. But those countries continue to invest funds to maintain their systems.
#Person1#: So, you're balancing between two extremes to some extent. On one hand, you don't want to lose too much money, and on the other, you need to provide the best possible service.
#Person2#: Yes, that's correct.","#Person2# holds the view that the increasing presence of automobiles led to a steady decline in the profits of railways, necessitating the nationalization of the railway system to address this issue. #Person1# appreciates #Person2# for striving to provide the best possible service while minimizing the loss of revenue."

#Person2#: My car broke down. 
#Person1#: Oh no, again? 
#Person2#: Yeah. I checked the oil and pretty much everything else, but it just won't start.

#Person2#: I know, I know. But here's the thing, I need to pick up Tom from the airport. Do you think I could borrow your car...? 
#Person1#: You want to use my car? Sure, no problem.

#Person1#: When was your last medical check-up?
#Person2#: It was two months ago.
#Person1#: Let me check your blood pressure. You seem anemic. Well, Mr. Brown, it's not too serious. You're just a bit run down from overwork.

#Person1#: I believe you need a vacation. Engage in some outdoor activities and rest thoroughly.

#Person2#: I'm doing well. How about you? 
#Person1#: Just okay. I'm absolutely exhausted. Our company keeps piling on these training sessions non-stop these days. 
#Person2#: Well, that's a good thing. Not every company offers training opportunities to their employees. It seems like your company wants to help employees grow more and encourage lifelong learning. 
#Person1#: Great, huh? It's great for the company, but not for me. 
#Person2#: So, what's the problem then? 
#Person1#: I have to attend these training sessions after a busy day at work and during the weekends. You know, after work, I just want to hit the sack, and on weekends, I want to relax at home, have dinner with my family, and unwind. 
#Person2#: True, you've got a point there. But if we don't learn every day, it's hard to maintain our intellectual abilities. Continuous learning helps us sharpen our logical thinking, analytical skills, and judgment. 
#Person1#: I see where you're coming from. But why can't they just hold the training during weekdays instead of weekends? 
#Person2#: You're right, weekends are for family time and relaxation. Maybe you should suggest that to your boss.","#Person1# expressed dissatisfaction to Chandler about the company's extensive schedule of training sessions, which has significantly reduced their leisure time. Chandler acknowledged the importance of training but disagreed with the practice of scheduling these sessions during weekends."

#Person1#: Did you get accepted into the program?
#Person2#: Yeah, that's right.
#Person1#: That's fantastic. You must be really excited.
#Person2#: I am excited, but also a bit nervous. I owe it all to Professor Mercheno. He wrote a recommendation letter for me and even bought me practice tapes and books to brush up on my basic conversational skills.
#Person1#: How fluent are you in Japanese?
#Person2#: Not very much right now. But I've enrolled in an intensive Japanese course this semester.
#Person1#: You really have a talent for foreign languages. I wish I could study abroad too.
#Person2#: Then why don't you? Our school has plenty of overseas programs that don't require foreign language proficiency. The tuition fees are similar too. As long as you're open to new perspectives and willing to adapt to different lifestyles, you can definitely do it.
#Person1#: I thought all programs required foreign languages. I'll have to look into it.
#Person2#: You'll never regret it.","Rason is preparing for a year-long stay in Japan and is actively improving her proficiency in the Japanese language.

#Person1#: Of course, I made it myself.
#Person2#: I'm really sorry. It seems there was some kind of error. Let me check again. Oh, I see. It's registered as 'Tommy Bush.' It's probably a mistake by the staff who registered your name. I apologize for the inconvenience.
#Person1#: That's alright.
#Person2#: According to our records, your reservation is for a single room with a shower and air conditioning, for two nights. The room rate is $110 per night, including a 10% tax and a 4% service charge. Is that correct?

"summarize: topic: Negotiation of Payment Terms dialogue: #Person1#: Alright, now that we've settled on price, quality, and quantity, what about the payment terms?
#Person2#: We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit, which is disbursed according to the invoice documents.
#Person1#: Oh, I see. Is it possible to make an exception and accept D/A or D/P instead?
#Person2#: I'm sorry, but a letter of credit is mandatory.
#Person1#: To be honest, a letter of credit increases my import costs. When I open a letter of credit with the bank, I have to make a deposit, which ties up my money and raises my costs.
#Person2#: Talk to your bank and see if you can minimize the required deposit.
#Person1#: Even so, there will still be financial charges associated with the letter of credit. It would be a huge help if you could accept D/A or D/P instead. You can draw on me as if there were a letter of credit. That would make a big difference for me, but not for you.
#Person2#: Well, as Mr. Wang knows, an irrevocable letter of credit provides an additional layer of protection in the form of bank guarantees for the exporter. We always require a letter of credit for exports. On the flip side, we also pay by letter of credit when importing.
#Person1#: How about we compromise and do 50% by letter of credit and the rest by D/P?
#Person2#: I'm very sorry, Mr. Wang, but I don't think we can offer that arrangement either. As I mentioned earlier, we must receive payment by letter of credit.","Mr. Wang prefers to use D/A or D/P payment methods due to the increased costs associated with letters of credit, but #Person2# insists on payment by letter of credit because it provides additional security through bank guarantees. This difference in preference arises from Mr. Wang's concern over rising expenses and #Person2#'s emphasis on the enhanced protection offered by letters of credit."
"summarize: topic: Travel Itinerary Planning dialogue: #Person1#: I was wondering if there are any specific places you'd like to see before we finalize our tour plans.
#Person2#: Actually, we discussed this last night, and everyone's really eager to visit the Great Wall, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. I feel like it would be a shame to come all the way to China and not see it. By the way, how far is it from here?
#Person1#: It's roughly about 50 kilometers away, which should take about an hour and a half by car. We'll definitely include the Great Wall in your itinerary.
#Person2#: Great! And I've also heard a lot about the Summer Palace; I'd love to see that as well.
#Person1#: Understood. We'll add the Summer Palace to the schedule, and I'll also recommend some other fascinating spots like the Temple of Heaven, the Old Summer Palace, and the Ming Tombs for you to consider.","#Person2# expressed to #Person1# their interest in visiting the Great Wall and the Summer Palace.

#Person2#: Yes, I'm doing fine. I had some issues with my stomach, nothing too serious, though I won't go into all the details.
#Person1#: I really dislike going to the hospital.
#Person2#: Most people get a bit nervous about it, don't they? I was really anxious right before the surgery, but after the anesthesiologist gave me the medication, I only remember waking up.
#Person1#: I bet you were in a lot of pain after the surgery.
#Person2#: Even with all the painkillers the nurse gave me, I was still quite uncomfortable. The hardest part was not being able to eat anything for 48 hours.
#Person1#: Must have made you crave a thick steak when you got out of the hospital.
#Person2#: You bet! But the doctor gave me a list of foods I couldn't eat for another 72 hours, and guess what was on it? Steak!
#Person1#: Are you pain-free now?
#Person2#: Yes, completely. I haven't taken any painkillers for a few days now.
#Person1#: Did they take good care of you in the hospital?
#Person2#: Oh, yes. The nurses were so kind, and even though they were strict about what I could drink, I only had water. Everyone was really professional. In a way, I even enjoyed my time there.",#Person2# recounted their experience at the hospital to #Person1# and mentioned that they are currently free from pain.
"summarize: topic: Sweater Purchase dialogue: #Person1#: That dress is really pretty, but why don't you like it? 
#Person2#: It's too attention-grabbing.
#Person1#: We've been looking around for such a long time. What are you trying to find, exactly?
#Person2#: Well, I feel like the style or color doesn't suit me.
#Person1#: What kind of style do you want?
#Person2#: I want to buy a v-neck, plaid, fitted sweater.
#Person1#: Oh, I see. What about the color?

#Person2#: Yes, I have a master's degree in drama and theater, and I'm currently working on getting into a Ph.D. program.
#Person1#: What do you find most interesting about theater?
#Person2#: Well, I see theater as a way to study people and their communication. It helps me learn how to read people, even when they're lying. So, I can usually figure out what they mean, even if they're not telling the truth.
#Person1#: That must come in handy.
#Person2#: Yes, it's really useful for me. Since I'm an English instructor, I often use theater techniques like role-playing in my classes. I even have students create mini-dramas, and they really enjoy it. These days, I'm thinking about pursuing a Ph.D. because I want to introduce Asian theater to the world. I'm not sure how successful I'll be, but I'm hopeful.
#Person1#: Oh, Claire, I'm sure you'll succeed! By the way, Claire, how do you deal with stage fright?
#Person2#: Stage fright? Many actors struggle with that. I find that I get stage fright every time I teach a new class. The night before, I usually can't sleep well.
#Person1#: Really? Because of teaching?
#Person2#: Yes, I get a lot of stage fright. But once I'm in the classroom or on stage, everything falls into place. Then I just think, Ah! This is what I'm supposed to be doing. After that, I feel fine.
#Person1#: Wow, that's really impressive!","Claire incorporates theater into her English lectures and is contemplating pursuing a doctoral degree in the field of theater. Despite having stage fright, she mentions that she manages to overcome it once she is actually on stage."
"summarize: topic: 72-Hour Kit Preparation dialogue: #Person1#: Hey, Tim. Are you shopping before the weekend? 
#Person2#: No, actually, I'm looking for supplies to prepare a 72-hour kit for each family member. 
#Person1#: A 72-hour kit? What's that? 
#Person2#: It's basically a set of emergency supplies that can help you survive for three days in case of an emergency, like an earthquake. 
#Person1#: Earthquake? It's been a while since the last one. 
#Person2#: True, but you never know when it might hit, so it's always better to be prepared. It's not just earthquakes, but also floods, hurricanes, blizzards, power outages, or fires. 
#Person1#: Okay, so what goes into a 72-hour kit? 
#Person2#: You need enough food and water for three days, and in some cases, you might need to prepare a water filter or purification tablets. Also, you should prepare food that's easy and can be stored for a long time, and try to avoid canned food as much as possible. It's inconvenient if you don't have a can opener. I recommend energy bars, beef jerky, nuts, raisins, or chocolate. 
#Person1#: The food might not taste great, but for survival, I guess it's worth it. 
#Person2#: Actually, there are some tasty options too. For snacks, candy bars are not a bad idea. And you need to decide on a shelter. 
#Person1#: I wish we could stay in a hotel. 
#Person2#: That would be nice, but most likely, you'll have to evacuate to a shelter with many other people. 
#Person1#: Then it'll be cramped and probably not very hygienic... 
#Person2#: That's right, so it's always good to have an emergency sleeping bag or a small tent ready. 
#Person1#: Wow. 
#Person2#: And you also need a flashlight, a portable radio, extra batteries, a small first aid kit, personal items like toothpaste... and extra clothes. 
#Person1#: What about money? I only have credit cards. 
#Person2#: That's true. However, they're useless during a power outage. It's better to have some small denomination bills and coins. 
#Person1#: What if our family gets separated? 
#Person2#: That's why it's good to have a walkie-talkie and set a meeting place in advance. 
#Person1#: The plan is quite detailed. 
#Person2#: That's not all. You also need to prepare for the weather, like raincoats, jackets, and tools to start a fire. 
#Person1#: Like matches? 
#Person2#: Matches won't work if they get wet. You need three fire-starting tools: a magnifying glass, a high-quality lighter, and waterproof matches. 
#Person1#: Wow, I never thought about that. What if we have young children? 
#Person2#: That's right, you need to prepare for them too. They'll get bored in a shelter, so you should pack some card games, paper, and crayons. 
#Person1#: Seeing all this, it really is necessary to prepare a 72-hour kit. 
#Person2#: Exactly, but people rarely do this kind of preparation.","Tim informed #Person1# about his preparations for an emergency situation by assembling a 72-hour kit for his family. During their conversation, they discussed essential items to include in the kit, such as food, water, shelter, a fire-starting tool, and supplies specifically for children. Through this discussion, #Person1# gained a deeper understanding of the importance of having a well-prepared 72-hour kit for emergencies."

"summarize: topic: Job Interview dialogue: #Person1#: Have you ever worked in a similar position before?
#Person2#: Yes, I worked for four years at ABC Insurance Company and prior to that, I was a claims agent at Pacific Survey Company.
#Person1#: Could you please tell me the typical procedure for handling such cases?
#Person2#: Certainly. Once the cargo arrives, the shipper's side will pass all relevant documents to the consignee. The consignee must carefully check the packing list and weight list, and if the cargo arrives damaged or short, a joint survey should be requested from representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent. Based on the survey report, a claim for compensation will be made.
#Person1#: If you were to work as our representative, how would you protect our interests?
#Person2#: I would first request the survey report of the shipment from the consignee. If they fail to present it, I would advise the case to the shipper. Also, bad weather can be a good reason to deny liability.
#Person1#: Are you capable of telex work?
#Person1#: Yes, I used to send telexes to the shipper and consignee regarding changes in the dispatch schedule and other information.
#Person1#: How is your English reading and writing proficiency?

"summarize: topic: Social Issues dialogue: #Person1#: What do you think is the most pressing social issue that the government should focus on?
#Person2#: I believe the housing crisis is a major concern. There are so many homeless individuals on the streets.
#Person1#: How would you propose solving that issue?
#Person2#: I have a good idea to address it. The government could provide financial support to help the homeless build their own homes.
#Person1#: That would probably be quite expensive.
#Person2#: I think the government could afford it. Plus, there are many advantages. Once the homeless have an address, finding a job becomes easier, and they could also learn necessary skills for construction or home renovation.
#Person1#: That's not a bad idea. I think education is currently the biggest issue. Schools seem to lack the budget to properly educate children.
#Person2#: To invest more funds in education, they would need to raise taxes. That wouldn't be popular with voters.
#Person1#: Most voters want it both ways. They want the government to do a lot, but they don't want taxes to increase.
#Person2#: The government needs to demonstrate that they are using funds efficiently. Sometimes, we hear rumors that the government has wasted money on projects.

The government must show that they are using the limited funds responsibly.","#Person2# believes that the housing issue is significant, while #Person1# considers education to be the most pressing concern.

#Person2#: Oh, and how old is the apartment complex?
#Person1#: Well, you could say it has some history. To be honest, my great-grandfather built it in the 1920s, but the building is very solid and sturdy.
#Person2#: Oh, and... So, how much furniture is included?
#Person1#: Oh, yes. The apartment comes partially furnished with a refrigerator, a gas stove, and my grandmother's old dishwasher.
#Person2#: Your grandmother's old dishwasher, huh? Okay. What's the monthly rent?
#Person1#: It's $950 a month.

#Person1#: It's about eight blocks from the campus, and there are several buses you can take right in front.
#Person2#: Oh, and is there a lot of noise from a busy road in front?
#Person1#: Well, it's a trade-off. It can be a bit noisy because of the road and the airport nearby, but there's a supermarket and shopping center right across the street, which is very convenient. Just keep the windows closed and have some earplugs ready, and you should be fine.
#Person2#: I see, one last question. Is there any parking space for tenants?
#Person1#: Yes, there are two covered parking spaces for the apartments. They're very useful at certain times of the year.
#Person2#: Hmm... I'm not sure. Can I come by tomorrow morning to see the apartment?

#Person2#: No way. Don't even think about it.
#Person1#: How about Saturday then?

"summarize: topic: Economic Recession dialogue: #Person1#: It's really challenging to stay optimistic given the current state of the economy... The trade deficit is expanding, consumer spending is dwindling, and I genuinely believe we're heading towards a recession.
#Person2#: The economy has been in a slump for quite some time now. It feels like we've been stuck in a downturn for months. The trade deficit is what concerns me the most. I think the government should do more to promote exports.
#Person1#: If exports increase, our currency's value will weaken. I believe the most crucial aspect is economic growth. We need more jobs. Factories are sending so many jobs overseas that our unemployment rate is rising, consumer spending is decreasing, and production is shrinking, which ultimately weakens the economy further.

That will lead to inflation, making the economy much less dynamic.","#Person1# and #Person2# are engaged in a discussion regarding the economic recession.

#Person1#: 은행에서 여행자 수표 서비스를 사용하려고 하는데, 어떤 점을 주의해야 할까요?

#Person2#: 여행자 수표를 사용할 때는 몇 가지 주의사항이 있습니다. 먼저, 수표를 구매할 때 필요한 신분증을 준비해야 합니다. 또한, 수표를 사용할 국가의 환율을 미리 확인하고, 현지에서 수표를 현금화할 때 수수료가 발생할 수 있으니 이를 고려해야 합니다. 마지막으로, 수표를 분실하거나 도난당할 경우를 대비해 수표 번호와 구매 내역을 기록해 두는 것이 좋습니다.

#Person1#: 주택담보대출을 받으려고 하는데, 현재 금리는 어떻게 되나요?

#Person2#: 현재 주택담보대출의 금리는 여러 요인에 따라 다를 수 있습니다. 일반적으로 고정금리와 변동금리 두 가지 옵션이 있습니다. 고정금리는 대출 기간 동안 일정한 이자율을 유지하는 반면, 변동금리는 시장 금리에 따라 변동될 수 있습니다. 구체적인 금리는 대출 금액, 대출 기간, 신용등급 등에 따라 달라질 수 있으니, 은행에 직접 문의하여 자세한 정보를 얻는 것이 좋습니다.

#Person1#: 금리가 변동될 수 있는 변동금리 대출의 장단점은 무엇인가요?

Multimodal transportation refers to the integration of two or more different modes of transport, such as rail, road, sea, and air, to move goods efficiently and effectively from origin to destination. This approach is essential for several reasons:

1. **Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness**: By utilizing the strengths of different transport modes, multimodal transportation can reduce overall transit times and costs. For example, using rail for long-distance haulage and trucks for last-mile delivery can optimize logistics.

2. **Flexibility**: It offers greater flexibility in routing and scheduling, allowing for adjustments based on demand, seasonality, or unforeseen disruptions.

3. **Environmental Benefits**: By strategically choosing the most suitable modes, it can lead to reduced carbon emissions, as some modes like rail are more energy-efficient than others.

4. **Risk Mitigation**: Diversifying transport methods can mitigate risks associated with relying on a single mode, such as strikes, weather disruptions, or congestion.

5. **Global Reach**: It facilitates international trade by seamlessly connecting different regions and continents through various transport networks.

Overall, multimodal transportation is a strategic approach that enhances supply chain resilience and sustainability."

Does it mean you don't trust each other?"" I understand the negative reaction, but in reality, a prenup is a way to learn more about each other and discuss any concerns comfortably.

#Person2#: True, but I feel like directors these days are more focused on making money than creating good films.
#Person1#: That's true. The film industry is becoming increasingly commercialized. There are a lot of expensive movies, but they don't have much artistic value. I think that, on average, the films made in the 40s are of higher quality than today's movies. There are many classics from that period that we can point to.

#Person2#: Absolutely, I've been working as a paralegal for the past ten months at an agency specializing in the legal field. I've been supporting attorneys, primarily in labor law, and applying my paralegal education to real-world scenarios. I've been recognized for my ability to take information and turn it into usable materials. I genuinely love research and analyzing facts, and I majored in English Literature in college, so my writing skills are a strong suit. That's why I'm seeking a position where I can utilize my research and writing abilities. 
#Person1#: What do you believe are the key qualities needed to succeed as a paralegal? 
#Person2#: I think flexibility is the most important quality. At my previous job, I supported four attorneys, and it was common for all of them to give me important tasks in a single day or week. So, I had to keep track of everything and adjust priorities accordingly. I'd discuss the urgency of tasks with each attorney to ensure nothing was overlooked, and at the same time, make each attorney feel their project was a priority in my schedule. I also think communication is a crucial quality. Talking with each attorney to explain my situation and get their input worked well. 
#Person1#: Can you share a specific example of when you had to go beyond your job description? 
#Person2#: There was a really important project that required research and completion by the weekend. I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks, and for two days before the final work, I stayed until 2 a.m. with my supervisor. It was really rewarding to see the project completed and the excellent results after putting in so much effort. My supervisor recognized this extra effort and gave me a bonus. 
#Person1#: Tell me about a time when you faced an obstacle while researching a case. 
#Person2#: I remember a case with many obstacles. The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases with similar situations. After gathering the facts, I tried to piece them together and analyze the next steps. During lunch, I happened to meet another attorney who could provide input. By working hard and digging through the materials, I was able to overcome most of the obstacles and took my findings to my supervisor for suggestions. After discussing, we eventually solved it, and my supervisor was impressed with what I had done. 
#Person1#: What are your strengths and weaknesses? 
#Person2#: My strength is my strong passion for finishing work. I'm results-oriented and have always met all deadlines. As for my weakness, I really enjoy my work, so sometimes it takes too much time. However, I'm aware of my tendency to overwork and am learning to pace myself. 
#Person1#: Can you share an experience where you had a confrontation with a coworker or supervisor? 
#Person2#: I had an issue with a coworker, and I asked if I could have a conversation with her. Through a good discussion, I found out she had no idea how her actions were affecting me and that she needed an explanation of the procedures. I took the time to explain the procedures, and there haven't been any issues since then. 
#Person1#: When do you find your work most satisfying? 
#Person2#: I feel the most satisfaction when my work provides an experience of growth. When I first started as a paralegal, there was a lot to learn, but through hard work, advice from good mentors, and continuous education, I've improved a lot now. I've learned to be as flexible as possible and how to handle difficult people with a positive attitude. 
#Person1#: How would your coworkers describe you? 
#Person2#: They would probably say I'm full of energy and enthusiasm. I enjoy working with people a lot. They would also say I have excellent customer service skills. I put the client first. Lastly, they would say I know the law well. I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal. 
#Person1#: Do you have any questions? 
#Person2#: Yes, I do. If you were to rate the morale within the company on a scale from 1 to 10, what would it be?","During the interview, #Person1# inquired about #Person2#'s job search, to which #Person2# responded that they were seeking a position where they could utilize their research and writing skills. #Person2# mentioned their previous role as a paralegal for 10 months and emphasized that adaptability and communication are crucial for success in that position.

"summarize: topic: Human Memory Training dialogue: #Person1#: Today on the Mind Matters program, we're speaking with human memory expert Dr. Ann Winters. Ann, welcome to the program. Now, I'm sure the first question on everyone's mind is, what is human memory? 
#Person2#: Well, like many easy questions, the answer isn't so straightforward. Basically, human memory is a space in the brain where we store images, much like a computer's hard disk drive. And just like a hard disk drive, our memories can be infected or erased by accidents. But it's different from a computer in that we can train our memories to expand and work better, something computers can't do yet. 
#Person1#: When you say memories can be infected, is that due to diseases? 
#Person2#: Yes, that's right. For instance, people with physiological diseases like Alzheimer's forget things that happened in the past. They even forget simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Studies show that people with higher education or more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease. 
#Person1#: So, how can we exercise our brains? Is it just by thinking a lot? 
#Person2#: That's partly true. But you can also practice using your memory, which not only exercises your brain but also improves your memory. Unfortunately, in modern life, many devices are designed to prevent us from forgetting things, which can make our brains lazier and weaken our memory. 
#Person1#: Could you give us some examples of how we can exercise our memory? 
#Person2#: Sure, there's a very simple technique that works better for some people. When you want to remember something, think of an object that reminds you of it. For example, I want to remember a historical date, 1066, the year of the Battle of Hastings. I imagine a bottle labeled 1066 if that battle reminds me of a bottle (bottle). And then I think of that bottle.",#Person1# engages in a conversation with human memory expert Dr. Ann Winters about the nature of human memory during an interview.

#Person1#: Well, I suppose we can talk about it then. If it's a large amount, what figure are you thinking of?
#Person2#: It means at least doubling this year's sales.
#Person1#: That's too much for us.
#Person2#: I know your company has contributed a lot to our export expansion. However, our company has regulations regarding agency agreements.
#Person1#: I understand. We'll take on that challenge. So, what will the commission be? Typically, we receive 20% of the transaction amount as commission.
#Person2#: I'm sorry, but that's a bit high. Other regional agents usually receive a 3% to 6% commission.
#Person1#: As you know, we have competitors from Korea and other countries. We have to overcome sales resistance at the beginning of the campaign, send salespeople for market research, and spend a significant amount on newspaper and TV advertising. With a 20% commission, there's not much left over.

"summarize: topic: Inventions and Patents dialogue: #Person1#: I don't get how inventors make money from their inventions. Anyone can just copy and sell them, right? Seriously, what's the point of a patent? It's just a piece of paper, isn't it? You can't even see it, so what's the point? 
#Person2#: Thanks for the question. Actually, when an inventor has a patent, they are protected by the laws of the country where the invention was developed. If someone makes and sells that product without permission, the inventor can take them to court. 
#Person1#: What kind of outcome can the inventor expect if they win the lawsuit? 
#Person2#: The court can take several actions, but there's no guarantee. Commonly, they can receive compensation, or an order to stop manufacturing and selling that product. In some cases, they might even order the destruction of those products. 
#Person1#: Can the person being sued defend themselves? 
#Person2#: That's right. Unfortunately, it's hard to get away with not knowing the law, but the other party can counter-sue by claiming they are the original inventor. 
#Person1#: You said inventors are protected by the laws of that country. Is everything fair? Do all countries have the same laws? 
#Person2#: No, they're not all the same. You're right; in theory, they are, but in reality, there are many cases where they are being adjusted. The World Trade Organization created an agreement on intellectual property rights, which keeps patents valid for 20 years. 
#Person1#: That doesn't make much sense. Twenty years is too long. 
#Person2#: Actually, that's the case. It's believed that inventors are more likely to quickly produce and release their products to the market after receiving a patent because there's a 20-year limit. On the other hand, other inventors can utilize that information once it's made public. Providing information is part of a patent. 
#Person1#: That's interesting.","#Person2# explained to #Person1# how patents serve to protect inventors, noting that a court can mandate compensation or prohibit the manufacture and sale of a product. Furthermore, another party may contest this by claiming to be the original inventor and file a countersuit. Patents remain valid for a period of 20 years."

"summarize: topic: Negotiation Skills dialogue: #Person1#: Mr. Green, do you think negotiation is an art?
#Person2#: Well, in my opinion, negotiation is both an art and a science. Negotiations can be prepared scientifically, but the actual process involves a lot of artistic sensibility. The scientific part of negotiation involves strategy. It's about deciding what you want and what you can give. It also includes tactics, like how to approach the other party and whether to set your initial negotiation position differently from your final goal. The behavioral aspect is also crucial.
#Person1#: What do you mean by the behavioral aspect?
#Person2#: This is where the art comes in, I believe. In behavior, you can be an actor, pretending to dislike something you actually like or pretending to like something you don't need. Alternatively, you can be an honest negotiator who does everything straightforwardly. The artistic part, I think, lies in reacting instantly to the signals that come up during the negotiation process. Those signals can be verbal or non-verbal. This is where your artistic sensibility comes into play.
#Person1#: So, in the end, you see two types of negotiators: actors or honest people.
#Person2#: That's right. And both types can work well. An honest negotiator can be effective in certain situations, while an actor might be needed in others.","Mr. Green describes negotiation as both an art and a science, focusing on the behavioral aspects. He explains that a negotiator can be either an actor or an honest person, and both approaches can be effective depending on the situation. In the role of an actor, a negotiator might employ tactics such as bluffing or misrepresentation to gain an advantage. Conversely, being honest and straightforward can also be a strategic choice, fostering trust and credibility, which can lead to more sustainable and mutually beneficial agreements. The effectiveness of each approach depends on the context, the relationship between the parties, and the specific goals of the negotiation."

#Person1#: No, I don't. Do you have any final suggestions?
#Person2#: Yes. You shouldn't waste paper because trees are used to make paper. If you recycle paper, you can save the forests where animals live.

#Person2#: Do you mean someone who's passionate and skilled with computers?  
#Person1#: You could put it that way.  
#Person2#: But why do people view hackers so negatively?  
#Person1#: It's because they confuse hackers with crackers.

#Person1#: What about boys?
#Person2#: Nowadays, many parents of boys want to send them to co-educational schools. They think that girls will have a positive influence on boys.
#Person1#: So, generally, who performs better in co-educational schools?

#Person2#: I'm not sure. I just try my best to have good insurance because it's important.","#Person1# is contemplating enrolling in a health insurance plan. #Person2# explains that the reason the United States does not have a national health insurance system is because many Americans believe that private companies can provide better services than the government.

However, it's important to note that this view is subject to debate, as proponents of a national health system argue that it could provide more equitable and comprehensive coverage for all citizens."

#Person2#: You know, our department did a survey last year and found that 80% of psychology majors are working. That's why they created this program.
#Person1#: But isn't it a bit impersonal? I like discussing things during class and hearing what others think.

#Person1#: What do you mean?
#Person2#: We're stranded here, Tom. We might be here for a long time. We need to save the car's gas. The car's energy is what will keep us warm.

#Person2#: Yeah, it often happens. During big snowstorms, people get stuck for days.

#Person2#: Oh, it's nothing major. I just felt a bit down in the dumps.
#Person1#: Why? I thought you were thrilled about your new job and going to London.
#Person2#: I am, I am. But I guess being in this village for so long makes it hard to think of anywhere else as home. The worst part is not being able to walk the dog whenever I want.
#Person1#: I get it. But once you settle in, it'll be fine.
#Person2#: Of course it will. But it's different here. My friends are here, I know where all the local shops and cinemas are, and of course, you're here to look after me!

"summarize: topic: Small Television Market dialogue: #Person1#: Well, I think our listeners would be eager to hear the latest news on tiny televisions. 
#Person2#: It's definitely a growing market. They're getting smaller and smaller each year. 
#Person1#: Which countries are leading the market? 
#Person2#: As of now, it's mainly Japan. In the spring of 1982, Sony introduced the Watchman. 
#Person1#: Isn't that the Walkman? 
#Person2#: No, the Watchman is a portable black and white TV with a screen and an antenna. 
#Person1#: How big is it overall? 
#Person2#: Well, it's roughly 35 cm by 12 cm and weighs only a few kilograms. 
#Person1##: Was it successful from the start? 
#Person2#: Funny you should ask, because a Sony executive said people wouldn't want a TV they could walk around with, and that a slightly larger model was available for half the price! 
#Person1#: Really? 
#Person2#: But despite this negative outlook, sales of this model far exceeded expectations. 
#Person1#: You just never know, do you! What was the initial production? 
#Person2#: The company started with 2,000 units a month and increased to 5,000 by the end of 1982, but they couldn't keep up with demand. 
#Person1#: So they increased production further, I suppose. 
#Person2#: It was even more radical than that! In the spring of 1983, Sony went all out and relaunched the Watchman with a new model. 
#Person1#: Oh, what's it like? 
#Person2#: Well, it's 20% smaller and the price has been reduced by 25%... 
#Person1#: Hmm. 
#Person2#: And the components have been newly designed from scratch. 
#Person1#: And what about production? 
#Person2#: It's quadrupled to 20,000 units a month for the Japanese market alone! 
#Person1#: Wow! The Watchman has really taken off. 
#Person2#: It certainly has. 
#Person1#: I heard there are other Japanese companies too. 
#Person2#: Yes. In late 1982, Hattori-that's H-A-T-T-O-R-I by the way-the Seiko manufacturer known for their watches-introduced an even smaller TV built into a wristwatch. 
#Person1#: I can't believe it! 
#Person2#: It's true. The rest of the set is carried separately in your pocket and is about the size of a king-size cigarette packet. 
#Person1#: How does it work? 
#Person2#: It has a liquid crystal display screen, and the TV receiver and battery pack go in your pocket and are connected to the watch by a cord. 
#Person1#: Does it have an earphone too? 
#Person2#: Oh, yes, that's plugged into the receiver as well. 
#Person1#: It sounds a bit complicated with all those wires and bits. 
#Person2#: Yes, it does. 
#Person1#: Any other Japanese models? 
#Person2#: Yes, Casio-that's C-A-S-I-O. Their latest model is a calculator-sized TV, one-third the volume of the Watchman, with a production of 2,000 units a month in 1983. 
#Person1#: I see. 
#Person2#: According to a spokesman, they want to match their calculator sales of 25 million units a year. 
#Person1#: That's impressive. I'm sure other Japanese companies will follow suit. 
#Person2#: Probably. 
#Person1#: Now, can you tell us about the tiny TVs being made in other countries? 
#Person2#: Of course. Sinclair in the UK has a product similar in size to Casio's, and they produced 1 million units in 1983. 
#Person1#: It seems they're betting on it being a success! 
#Person2#: Indeed. A representative said they believe there will be a response in the mass market. Not just as a novelty. 
#Person1#: So, who is the market targeted at for manufacturers? 
#Person2#: Mainly commuters who spend long hours traveling to and from work. These TVs will provide a bit of fun to take their minds off the monotonous train or bus ride. 
#Person1#: Well, thank you for bringing us the news with such a popular device. 
#Person2#: My pleasure, and happy TV watching to you all.","#Person1# conducts an interview with #Person2# regarding the market for small televisions. #Person2# explains that Japan has been at the forefront of this market, with significant popularity emerging since Sony's introduction of the Watchman in 1982. Initially, production volumes could not keep up with demand, and by 1983, the product was reintroduced to the market with a new model, achieving even greater success. #Person2# also highlights the contributions of other Japanese companies such as Hattori and Casio, which have produced small TVs, with Casio manufacturing approximately 100,000 units. Furthermore, #Person2# mentions Sinclair from the UK, which has also produced a product of similar size, primarily targeting commuters."

The stories in newspapers tend to be accurate, but unfortunately, some people do spread false information to influence public opinion. So, you have to consider why a piece of news like that was released.

"summarize: topic: Bedroom Decoration dialogue: #Person1#: I'm considering redecorating my bedroom. I bought a magazine for some ideas. What do you think of this one?
